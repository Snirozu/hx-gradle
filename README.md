# HaxeGradle
A haxelib tool that helps you use gradle with haxe.

Install with `haxelib git hxgradle https://github.com/Snirozu/hx-gradle.git`. <br>
And run `haxelib run hxgradle` to use this tool.

# Requirements
You must install JDK before using this, not JRE!

If the compilation fails because `'jar' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file` then add JDK bin path to the system variables `Path` (`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-{your jdk version}\bin`)
